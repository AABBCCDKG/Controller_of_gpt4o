# EchoGen: Iterative Optimization System for LLM

## How to use it

To use this project, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. Follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI if you don't already have one.
2. In the `main.py` file, locate the following line:

   ```python
   #api_key = "<insert your api_key>"

## Overview

This project leverages the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT-4 to recognize objects in images and generate physical simulations. By combining image recognition, programming skills, and physics modeling, we aim to create a powerful tool for video prediction and object behavior simulation.

## Key Features

1. **Image-based Object Recognition**: Utilizes ChatGPT-4o's ability to process and analyze image inputs.
2. **Physics Modeling**: Translates recognized objects into code-based physics models.
3. **Simulation Integration**: Connects generated models with a physics engine to simulate future object states.
4. **Iterative Optimization**: Implements a controller to enhance accuracy and stability through repeated feedback loops.

## Methodology: Optimizing LLM Generation Results through Iterative Feedback

Our approach focuses on improving the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT-4o's output:

1. **Predefined Physics Engine Code**: We establish a standardized format for physics simulation code. Therefore, the result of ChatGPT-4o should be like:
   ```python
   add_ball(space, (100, 50), 25, 1, (200, 200))
3. **Multiple Independent Calls**: Each epoch involves three separate calls to ChatGPT-4o.
4. **Fact-based Prompting**: We provide ChatGPT-4o with facts that have over 50% accuracy.
5. **Similarity Analysis and Averaging**: Results from each epoch are processed using similarity metrics and averaging techniques. For example:
6. **Iterative Refinement**: We insert the processed results into the next epoch's prompt as a hint, stating "Hint: the parameters are probably:".

## Potential and Challenges

While this approach shows immense potential in video prediction and object behavior simulation, we acknowledge certain challenges:

- **Recognition Accuracy**: ChatGPT-4o's object recognition, while advanced, is not always precise.
- **Output Stability**: Generated results can vary, necessitating our optimization approach.
